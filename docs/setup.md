`0` **PreSteps:** 

Install Python 3.9 [Python3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/): Used to run the script

Install Git [StableGit](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Used to download this repository

For easier access install the GitHub app [Github](https://desktop.github.com/): Not Required

`1` **First:** You will need your discord token to run this SelfBot/XP-Grinder. You can either do the traditional way [Get Your Discord Token!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI). Or use my script: [Get Your Discord Token (BY ME)](https://github.com/ScopeOpen/Get-Token)

`2` **Second:** Once you have your discord token you need to input it in **brackets ""** of the token section of `config.json` like in the provided screenshot.

`3` **Third:** Make sure to save and keep config.json open. Go to your desired discord server and copy the id of the memes/media channel or a channel you'd like to send your gif/images in [Get An ID From Discord Channel](https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/how-to-find-discord-id)

`4` **Fourth:** Paste that ID **ONLY ONE!** into the brackets of the memes section in `config.json` Like in the provided screenshot

`5` **Fifth:** This last part is for the cool-down of sending messages. Unless you know the time of the xp cool-down of the server dont replace the numbers. If you do take the xp cool-down time and `+3` that will be your `firstTime` then add `+5` onto that number and that will be your `secondTime`. What this does is randomise the times when messages will be sent between those two numbers. Save and exit config.json

`6` **Sixth:** Open up phrases.txt. This is going to be where every one of the possible messages that can be sent will be stored, Every line = new message. Once finished putting messages or anything in there save and exit. 

`7` **Seventh:** Put all your images/gif in the memes folder and save it. Supported file types: `png/jpg/gif`

`8` **Eigth:** Run the script `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the required libraries for the script to work

`9` **Ninth:**
