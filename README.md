A great tool to help those who love getting xp to be on the top of all level leaderboards but just can't compete with that one **no-lifer that doesn't stop talking on discord.** This is going to be the most optimised, smart & customisable xp farmers to this day.

## How To Setup
`1` **First:** You will need your discord token to run this SelfBot/XP-Grinder. You can either do the traditional way [Get Your Discord Token!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI). Or use my script: [Get Your Discord Token (BY ME)](https://github.com/ScopeOpen/Get-Token)

`2` **Second:** Once you have your discord token you need to input it in **brackets ""** of the token section of `config.json` like in the provided screenshot.

`3` **Third:** Make sure to save and keep config.json open. Go to your desired discord server and copy the id of the memes/media channel or a channel you'd like to send your gif/images in [Get An ID From Discord Channel](https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/how-to-find-discord-id)

`4` **Fourth:** Paste that ID **ONLY ONE!** into the brackets of the memes section in `config.json` Like in the provided screenshot

`5` **Fith:** This last part is for the cool-down of sending messages. Unless you know the time of the xp cool-down of the server dont replace the numbers.
